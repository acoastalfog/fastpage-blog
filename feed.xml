It was pretty terrible. I built it almost a decade ago while I was still a graduate student as not much more than a publicly-facing CV; quickly though, as my career advanced, I found it daunting to keep my record of academic work up to date on every platform that was expected. My website was at the absolute bottom of the list, and so never got updated. A website is a great place to &lt;em&gt;actually talk about what you are doing&lt;/em&gt;, and so I have been meaning to figure out what to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been here in Taiwan on a mini-sabbatical trip working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://meda.ai/&quot;&gt;MeDA Lab&lt;/a&gt;, especially our joint students and collaborations with &lt;a href=&quot;http://aisinai.org/&quot;&gt;AISINAI&lt;/a&gt;, which has afforded me some time to rethink my public presence. So I’m re-launching my website with a mostly blog-like format and a simple &lt;a href=&quot;/about.html&quot;&gt;about me&lt;/a&gt; page that links to the various places you can get information about me, including my up to date CV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20200120-medalab.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Lunar New Year Holiday Party with MeDA Lab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this won’t solve the problem of the overwhelming manual annotation of one’s academic output, it cuts it down a bit, and provides a platform I will use to post to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anthonycosta&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-costa-17005a64/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to use this to spend some time discussing recent developments at &lt;a href=&quot;http://sinaibio.design&quot;&gt;Sinai BioDesign&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://aisinai.org&quot;&gt;AISINAI&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe document some fun side projects along the way. Also props to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastai/fast_template&quot;&gt;template&lt;/a&gt; used here from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fast.ai/&quot;&gt;fast.ai&lt;/a&gt;, which makes this ridiculously easy. I’m looking forward to blogging using Jupyter notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
Anthony&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="about" /><category term="blog" /><category term="taiwan" /><summary type="html">If you’re familiar with me, it’s probably not because of my website.
