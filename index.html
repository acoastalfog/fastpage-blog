## Welcome!
#### I'm hoping to get more into communicating with the outside world through this new blog. 
#### I'm extremely lucky to lead groups in clinical device innovation ([Sinai BioDesign](http://sinaibio.design)) and artificial intelligence ([AISINAI](http://aisinai.org)) at the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/). To find out more, you can visit my [about]({{site.baseurl}}/about/) page, get in touch via [twitter](https://twitter.com/anthonycosta), and download my cv [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/cv-latest.pdf).
